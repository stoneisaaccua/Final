   <br><br> <h2><u>Systems Analysis</u></h2>
    <br><span>by Mae Hunt</span>
  <p>Among libraries in Washington, DC, the DC Jail Library is one-of-a-kind. Since its founding in 2015, it has served residents at the DC Jail’s two correctional facilities: the Central Detention Facility (CDF) and the Correctional Treatment Facility (CTF). Stemming from a long history of controversies regarding the jail’s lackluster facilities and operations, the DC Department of Corrections (DCDOC) has launched plans to replace the DC Jail with a new facility. According to the <a href="https://doc.dc.gov/page/new-correctional-facility#:~:text=The%20District%20of%20Columbia%20Department,programs;%20and%20reentry%20supportive%20services.">DCDOC’s website</a>, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has allocated $463 million in the city’s FY 2025-FY 2030 capital budget proposal to design and construct this new, “state-of-the-art” correctional facility. A Washington Post article reported that it would take at least a decade for the city to complete this “ambitious, overdue effort to transform a troubled facility into a rehabilitative space” (Gathright, 2024). This proposed plan means that there is an opportunity for major changes to be made to the DC Jail Library’s current library system. These changes have the potential to align with the new DC Jail’s mission, “to modernize its approach to justice and confinement so those confined will be better prepared to reenter the community and change the trajectory of their lives.” (<a href="https://doc.dc.gov/page/new-correctional-facility#:~:text=The%20District%20of%20Columbia%20Department,programs;%20and%20reentry%20supportive%20services.">DCDOC, 2024</a>). </p>
<p>In order to understand why and how to make changes to the DC Jail Library, it is imperative to first understand its current system. The DC Jail Library is an example of a system that is limited by design. It is one of the 26 branches of the DC Public Library (DCPL), but entirely unique in its operation. </p>
  <p>Like all branches of the DC Public Library, the DC Jail Library is supported by the <a href="http://www.sirsidynix.com/about-us">SirsiDynix</a> library management system. Formed in 2005 by the merger of the Sirsi Corporation and the Dynix Corporation, SirsiDynix is one of the largest providers of library technology services in the world, utilized at over 23,000 libraries in over 70 countries. Supported by the SirsiDynix system, the <a href="https://www.dclibrary.org/research-learn">DCPL</a> is able to offer patrons access to over 7,000 publications, eBook and movie rentals, language learning resources and much more. However, the patrons at the DC Jail Library are unable to benefit from these services, because they are not permitted to access them. In fact, patrons of the DC Jail Library rarely interact with the digital system itself.  </p>
  <p>Since its inception in 2015, the DC Jail Library has been a collaborative institution, managed by both the DC Public Library and the Department of Corrections. Richard Reyes-Gavilan, Executive Director of the DCPL, spoke about the challenges faced by two very different organizations working together: “We’re all about openness and democracy, and everything goes. And the jail is about limits and rules and laws and regulations … But we had a similar goal, so I think in some ways we both adapted to the culture of the other to get [the library] up and running.” (Boyle, 2015). </p>
  <p>There is no better example of the DC Jail Library’s unconventional place in the wider DCPL organization than its early days. The DC Jail Library officially opened in the winter of 2015 with a collection of 2,500 books (Boyle, 2015). DC Jail Librarian Danielle Zoller reported only using printed-out Excel spreadsheets and color-coded stickers to keep track of what materials patrons had checked out. A more technologically advanced system was not in use upon launch, but eventually the DC Jail Library joined the rest of DCPL and adopted the SirsiDynix system. However, there are still many aspects of the DC Jail Library’s use of this system that sets it apart from the rest of DCPL. According to Zoller, books are checked out to the housing unit of the borrower in SirsiDynix, rather than the borrower themselves. The library staff keeps track of individual inmates who check out books by recording names and barcodes in physical spreadsheets.</p>
  <p>The DC Jail library occupies a physical space in the DC Jail’s Correctional Treatment Facility (CTF), and its collection has grown to over 10,000 books (Janezich, 2017). Inmates housed in the CTF were once able to visit the library and check out books, although this practice is no longer in effect due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to DCPL employee Jean Badalamenti, the DC Jail Library staff makes regular rounds with a book cart, alternating each week between serving the CDF and the CTF. Inmates can make requests with their tablets, or through their case managers. Inmates are not permitted to search the library’s catalog, but they can ask the librarians about contents of the collection, and request books either through their tablets or their case managers. If the library does not carry a requested book, the librarians will loan out the next closest book at their discretion. Inmates can check out up to two books at a time for a two-week checkout duration, with the option to renew at the end of the two weeks. </p>
  <p>The tablets the inmates use are part of a <a href="https://doc.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/doc/publication/attachments/PP%204500.1%20DOC%20Tablet%20Distribution%20Program%2003-30-2023.pdf">policy</a> launched in 2023, in which the DC Jail began providing free tablets to inmates in the CDF and CTF. Although the tablets themselves are free, there are still many services provided by the tablets that cost money. Therefore, an inmate may prefer to borrow a physical book from the library, rather than pay to rent an eBook. Inmates at the DC Jail have limited connectivity access through these tablets, and there is no open internet access available. </p>
  <p>Many aspects of the DC Jail’s system are sensible considering the transient nature of the DC Jail. The majority of inmates in the DC Jail are awaiting adjudication or serving time for misdemeanor offenses, meaning that, in theory, no one person should stay at the jail for very long. Therefore, it is easier for the library staff to check out books to housing units, rather than making individual accounts for each user. However, this contributes to a foundational element of the DC Jail that separates its patrons from the general public who patronize other DC public libraries. One of the DC Jail Library’s programs is to provide inmates with a library card upon release from jail. On one hand, this program is admirable because it provides patrons with immediate access to a more expansive selection of library resources as they are navigating reintegration into society. On the other, the stipulation that inmates are not permitted to have a library card while residing at the DC Jail demonstrates a further limit to what the system is allowed to accomplish. </p>
  <p>One final <a href="https://www.dclibrary.org/using-the-library/dc-jail-video-visitation">program</a> worth noting is the DC Jail Video Visitation program offered by the DC Public Library. This program allows users to virtually meet with friends and loved ones incarcerated in the DC Jail. Although not an official part of the DC Jail Library’s system, the DC Jail Video Visitation program marks another form of collaboration between the DC Public Library and the DC Department of Corrections. Furthermore, it is programming facilitated by the larger DCPL system that affects the day-to-day lives of inmates and their families.</p> 
 <p>It is difficult to evaluate the DC Jail Library’s system using Nielsen’s usability heuristics for two reasons. First, according to Zoller, the library’s digital system can only be accessed by library staff members. There is no “front end” of the system. The DC Jail Library’s <a href="https://www.dclibrary.org/plan-visit/dc-jail-library">featured page</a> on the broader DCPS website contains some basic information, but as actual patrons of the DC Jail Library are unable to access it, this page is not part of the library’s system. The online cataloging system is internal, meaning it would be impossible for an independent user to evaluate it using the heuristics that apply specifically to web design. Second, the DC Jail Library’s system fundamentally prioritizes restriction over usability. As the only DCPL branch that is managed in collaboration with the Department of Corrections, the DC Jail Library was created to serve incarcerated users who, by definition, do not have the same rights and freedoms as the typical library patron. Therefore, many aspects of the DC Jail Library’s system that would be seen as flaws elsewhere are there by design. For example, Nielsen’s third heuristic states that a quality system encourages user control and freedom, but the DC Jail aims to limit incarcerated users’ control and freedom by not providing access to the Internet or the library catalog. This is not to say that the DC Jail Library’s system was designed to be inconvenient; rather, that the system was not designed with usability as a priority.

  <br><br><h2><u>Critical Analysis</u></h2>
  <br><span>by Isabelle Brahana</span>
  <p>“When the prison gates slam behind an inmate, he does not lose his human quality; his mind does not become closed to ideas; his intellect does not cease to feed on a free and open interchange of opinions; his yearning for self-respect does not end; nor is his quest for self-realization concluded. If anything, the needs for identity and self-respect are more compelling in the dehumanizing prison environment.” (American Library Association)
</p>
  <p>Currently, access to recreational reading materials–as in, non-legal books and documents, since access to these is required by law–in jails, prisons, and other correctional institutions is patchy at best. Those libraries that do exist are often underfunded, undersupplied, and difficult for patrons to access; in jails and prisons without libraries, inmates rely on donations and books sent to them directly by family and friends . That is, if they are even permitted to accept them, given that censorship is allowed in penal institutions to a greater extent than anywhere else in the United States. 
</p>
  <p>Though not a perfect system, the DC Jail Library is an excellent model for other jails and prisons seeking, as all correctional institutions ought, to establish their own libraries. There are a number of factors that influence the implementation of jail and prison libraries, as well as three primary interested parties: the governments who will fund them, the patrons who will use them, and the librarians who will staff them. The DCJL seems to have found an excellent balance between all three, given that it operates with fairly low costs, is integrated with the broader DC Public Libraries, and provides relatively broad access to reading materials.</p>
 <p>The first question anyone asks, and at least ostensibly the primary barrier to any program that helps people, is cost. Of course, this is a reasonable concern to some extent, given the extraordinarily high costs involved in operating jails. A VERA survey found that they cost $47,057 per inmate per year to run; the Washington, DC Department of Corrections’ operating budget for 2023 was well over 200 million dollars. In light of these figures, the $300,000 operating costs of the DC Jail Library seem paltry, especially considering the fact that the entire category of Inmate Adjustment & Developmental Services is allocated nearly 13 million dollars in total (DC DOC 2023 FL0). The library’s budget, therefore–including books, staff, and operating costs–is a tiny drop in the bucket with an outsized return on investment.
</p> 
  <p>Education for incarcerated people in general has a massive impact on recidivism rates. According to a study by the Rand Corporation, individuals who participate in prison education programs have “28% lower odds of recidivating” than those who do not. For every dollar spent on prison education, “between $4 and $5 dollars [are saved] in three-year reincarceration costs” (Davis). The relatively inexpensive-to-run DC Jail Library, then, is likely contributing massively to future savings by helping to reduce reincarceration rates.
</p>
  <p>Access to books and education go hand-in-hand; even without formal programs, carceral facilities with libraries provide inmates the opportunity to engage with literature and technical material that serves them upon their release. Literacy and education rates among people involved with the justice system are notably low. 30% of people in state and federal prisons lack a high school diploma or GED, and 33% have low levels of literacy (Davis). It is impossible to learn to read, or to improve reading skills, without reading materials. Without libraries and educational programs, individuals have few opportunities to strengthen these skills and pursue learning, either on their own or with the support of a formalized program. And even beyond established prison education programs, libraries provide freedom and the opportunity to pursue one’s own interests, something that is critical to encouraging investment in personal development. Reading gives people power, over themselves and their minds, if nothing else; where can that do more good than in correctional institutions?</p>
 <p>The DC Jail Library’s integration with the broader DCPL also helps ensure that it runs as effectively as it does. Any affiliation with a larger organization means more resources, a wider knowledge base, and a sense of community and support for librarians and library staff. As the DCJL has grown and developed over the years, it has joined Sirsi, the DCPL ILS; the integration of technology reduces complexity and workload for librarians and provides inmates with easier, quicker, more reliable access to the library’s resources. 
</p>
  <p>As effective and important as the DC Jail Library and the work it does is, it is not a perfect system. Censorship thrives in penal institutions to an astounding degree, and while the fact that the DC Jail Library actually provides books places it far above some institutions which effectively prevent prisoners from accessing any books at all (Marquis and Luna), it is no exception. The library’s ban on hardback books is both understandable and reasonable, since it addresses the physical safety of everyone in the jail, and nearly all books release paperback versions. 
</p>
  <p>However, the DC Department of Corrections bans erotic and urban fiction in the DC Jail Library. This is typical across the United States, since laws aimed at prison censorship pass decision-making to prison officials, whose subjective judgment and biases shape the rules at any given institution. Ostensibly, “the Warden may reject a publication only if it is determined detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution or if it might facilitate criminal activity” (Cauley). Does this justify blanket bans on genres in which inmates might be interested, which might induce them to self-reflect, to learn about themselves and others? It is often far easier to develop empathy by looking first at those who are similar to us, who share our problems and experiences; once we can do that, we can more easily see the humanity in those whose differences are more pronounced. Banning urban literature from the DC Jail, whose inmates are likely to relate to it, may prevent some people who might have used urban fiction as a gateway from engaging with the library at all.
</p>
  <p>The fact that much of contemporary urban literature is written by and about Black people adds another layer of injustice (Glazer). 87.8% of DOC residents are Black (and given that only 45% of DC residents are Black, this is another distinct but intertwined issue) (DC DOC Facts). Again, banning an entire genre, largely created by and centering Black people living in urban areas, in a mostly-Black jail in a major urban area, is both unjust and counterproductive to the mission of increasing interest in reading, which has a demonstrably positive impact on the lives of incarcerated people.

  <br><br><h2><u>DIY Prison Information System: No Tech</u></h2>
  <br><span>by Jiton Davidson</span>
  <p>Former prisoner number 289-128 of the Maryland Department of Corrections is now known as Randall Horton, award-winning poet, and  the “only tenured professor in the United States with seven felony convictions.” After spending five years in the DC and Maryland correctional facilities for smuggling and selling drugs, Horton is currently a Ph.D. professor of English at the University of New Haven.
</p>
  <p>He is also a friend that I met at a Chicago State Black writers’ conference in the mid-2000s. He allowed me an interview about the prison library system where he served-time from 1996-2000. Interestingly, it was within the system that he was introduced to the prose of the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize, Gwendolyn Brooks, as well as award winning essayist and poet E. Ethelbert Miller, which changed his academic trajectory from sports therapy to English.
</p>
  <p>From the circulating library cart he was able to read the Washington Post as well as the NY Times where he sought to keep up with what to read. He would order books from the librarian, and then wait and pray that he’d get at least one book from his growing wish list. He was unsure if the books that never came were censured, though. He did not think about it at the time.
</p>
  <p>Horton says that there was a lot of intellectualism in both the DC and Maryland DOC. He, himself, was a Howard University dropout. So, even though they had no formal library in the late 1990s, they created their own information system that operated on five components. 
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The weekly library cart where they could check out a book already in circulation or order particular books.
</li>
    <li>The ice cart guys who circulated every night with refreshing cubes, and fresh knowledge from something new they just read or learned about.</li>
    <li> Impromptu day-room book club meeting where they “held court” discussing important books they had read since the last time. </li>
    <li>Circulating chapter copies from books they all liked and copied. One person would get the book and make copies. </li>
    <li>Actual books mailed to them from friends and family through established booksellers.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>While many were concerned about Y2K on the outside, prisoner 289-128 cohorts could not wait to get their eyes on the next chapter in the current Iceberg Slim novel in circulation. Fast-forward nearly 2 decades and Horton is invited by the ALA to participate on the committee to draft revised Standards for Incarcerated and Detained Individuals.
</p>
  <span><b>A Brief History of the American Library Association Standards for Incarcerated and Detained Individuals; 1992
</b></span>
  <p><b>FOREWARD:</b><i>This edition of "Library Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions" was preceded by "Objectives and Standards for Libraries in Adult Prisons and Reformatories. Approved in 1944 by both the American Prison Association, now known as the American Correctional Association (ACA), and the American Library Association (ALA), it was published in 1950 by the American Prison Association in the Library Manual for Correctional Institutions. In 1962, ACA published "Objectives and Standards for Libraries in Correctional Institutions. This document was reviewed and revised in 1966 by both ACA and ALA and published in A Manual of Correctional Standards. Replaced in 1981 with a new document entitled Library Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions, it was published by ALA in cooperation with ACA. In 1987, the Standards Review Committee of the Association of Specialized and Cooperative Library Agencies (ASCLA), a division of the American Library Association, assigned the responsibility for revising the 1981 document to the Library Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions Ad Hoc Subcommittee.  
</i></p>
  <span><b>Standards for Library Services for the Incarcerated or Detained, revised, 2024</b></span>
  <p><i>The new Standards will heed the current phenomenon of mass incarceration, the in inequitable incarceration rates of BIPOC individuals, and the rising rates of incarceration of women (especially women of color) and pay special attention to the incarceration of LGBTQIA+ individuals, undocumented individuals, and youth in jails, prisons, and other detention facilities, as well as to the information needs of returning individuals.
</p>
<p>The Standards have been updated as part of the Expanding Information Access for Incarcerated People initiative, based in San Francisco Public Library’s Jail and Reentry Services program and in coordination with the American Library Association.
</p>
<p>This project exists to locate library services to incarcerated people and to support the development of new services. This initiative and these resulting Standards are made possible by a generous grant from the Mellon Foundation.

<br><br><h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2>
  <br><span>by Isaac Stone</span>
  <p>	During my own time working as a staff member in the DC jail library and interacting daily with inmates, I quickly learned to appreciate all that the library offers its patrons. Throughout the housing units and cells, men and women who had previously never picked up a book turned into avid readers; previously illiterate inmates chose to spend their time building and refining their reading skills. Adorning the walls of the library above the bookshelves are drawings done by inmates who previously had no artistic skill – what appear to be professionally-done art pieces were, in fact, crafted by skills developed from instructional library books. Admittedly there is a certain danger in extolling incarceration as an educational environment, but that is admittedly a benefit given to DC jail inmates, should they choose to pursue. Multiple DC-based colleges and universities offer free classes to inmates, with the option of continuing with their degree studies after leaving the jail. GRE classes and proctored tests are offered, as are classes in skilled trades such as fiber optic cable installation and truck driving. </p>
  <p>	“When the prison gates slam behind an inmate, he does not lose his human quality; his mind does not become closed to ideas; his intellect does not cease to feed on an open interchange of opinions,” wrote Thurgood Marshall. In their 2019 “Prisoners’ Right to Read” statement, the American Library Association wrote that “Participation in a democratic society requires unfettered access to current social, political, legal, economic, cultural, scientific, and religious information.” Known as the “Nelson Mandela Rules,” the rights of incarcerated peoples to library access were enshrined in the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s Standard Minimum Rules for Treatment of Prisoners (Levin). Despite all the progress that has been made in recognizing the free speech rights of jail inmates, though, there is still much to improve upon when it comes to their libraries.  </p>
<p>	“Let’s be honest, there’s not much one can glean from Westerns, romance, and pulp fiction,” Kentucky inmate Derek Trumbo told The Hill in November 2023. (Though all three are quite popular, as I can glean from my own experience; James Patterson novels were practically used as currency.) Since both funding and censorship of book choice impacts jail libraries, inmates are often left with a limited selection of material to choose from. According to PEN America, an “even more pervasive form of censorship unique to prisons” is comprised of “content-neutral restrictions,” which force inmates’ content consumption to be at the whim of administrators, often under the pretext of safety and security (PEN America). This was something I witnessed firsthand at the DC jail. Inmates were often left confused as to why some things were allowed while others were not – including arguing against restrictions that seem reasonable. Upon being informed that hardback books were not allowed in the jail out of fear that they could be used as bludgeoning weapons, an inmate nonchalantly remarked that “we could just hit each other with our tablets if we wanted to,” referring to the tablets issued to well-behaved units. Several times a cloud of pepper spray would waft its way into the office (a repurposed supply closet) where my co-worker and I sorted and checked out books, and other times we were asked to leave the units when things were getting too rowdy. </p>
 <p>As my colleagues have noted, both content and cost are essential to determining what books are carried in jail libraries, with the DC jail library having a slightly modified version of the selection (only paperbacks) and the internal SIRSI Dynix system (books are electronically checked out to housing units, with inmates issued library cards after leaving) that are used by the rest of the DC Public Library system. DCPL also offers other services in conjunction with the jail and its inmates, such as offering video visitations on the second floor of the central Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library. The DC jail library also partners with <a href="https://freemindsbookclub.org/>outside nonprofit organizations</a>, helping to organize programs for inmates in areas such as journalism and theater. Like their neighborhood library counterparts, jail libraries often function as catch-all makeshift social services; in Brooklyn, for example, the jail library provides “Daddy & Me, Mommy & Me” classes to teach “early literacy skills to parents in the justice system and [help] them learn how they can play a role in their children’s educational development from afar” (BPL). Next door in Queens, the jail library offers a “Youth Justice Court,” working with “teens and youth to gain legal skills and leadership experience” (QPL). </p>
 <p>Co-sponsoring the 2023 <i>Prison Liberties Act</i>, Missouri Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver writes, “Every jail and prison should invest in having robust libraries and educational resources. It has long been proven that providing education in jails and prisons improves rehabilitative outcomes, reduces recidivism rates, and ultimately improves public safety and reduces incarceration costs” (Cleaver). Indeed, lowering recidivism rates via literacy and library service is a cost-saving measure; according to a Department of Education study in 2015, “High-quality correctional education – including postsecondary correctional education – has been shown to measurably reduce re-incarceration rates. By reducing recidivism, correctional education can ultimately save taxpayers money and create safer communities” (RAND).  </p>
 <p>As I learned through my time working at the DC jail, the benefits of a functioning jail library extend far beyond books. The jail library I worked in is not without its flaws, but its functionality can serve as a model to others of its kind. As part of generally needed carceral reform, a library that is more open to information and less censorious, we believe, is a good goal to work towards. A good place to start would be to implement clear guidelines for book donations, streamlining the process to get the books from donators’ hands to the inmates. Another would be to lift bans on genres such as urban fiction, which are widely beloved desired among inmates. Improvements could be made to digital interaction and expanding access to the full catalogue. Still, providing recreational reading material and events programming is a valuable part of any life, behind bars or not. </p>
